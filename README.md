Smoker is a toy example app to examine how SMART on FHIR launch works.

See details on the [launch](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html).

This can be tested using the public launch tester [here](https://launch.smarthealthit.org/).
Use a target url of "http://localhost:3000/launches/initiate" to test.

A good test will show a page with "Launch initiated" with the exchanged OAuth token printed to the screen.
